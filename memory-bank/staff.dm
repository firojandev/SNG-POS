# Staff CRUD Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the Staff CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality implemented for the SNG-POS system. The Staff module manages user accounts that represent staff members, utilizing the existing User model and users table. Each staff member is associated with a store and has login credentials.

## Database Schema

### Table: users (existing table)
```sql
- id (bigint, primary key, auto-increment)
- store_id (varchar 255, nullable) - Foreign key to stores table
- name (varchar 255, required)
- email (varchar 255, required, unique)
- email_verified_at (timestamp, nullable)
- password (varchar 255, required, hashed)
- phone (varchar 255, nullable)
- designation (varchar 255, nullable) - Job designation/title
- address (text, nullable)
- avatar (varchar 255, nullable)
- remember_token (varchar 100, nullable)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
- deleted_at (timestamp, nullable) - Soft delete timestamp
```

### Key Features
- Uses existing User model and users table
- Store association via store_id foreign key
- Login credentials with email and password
- Comprehensive validation rules
- Password hashing for security
- Optional phone, designation, and address fields
- Soft delete functionality for data preservation

## Files Structure

### Backend Files
```
app/Models/User.php                            - Enhanced User model with store relationship
app/Http/Controllers/Admin/StaffController.php - Controller with CRUD operations
app/Http/Requests/StaffStoreRequest.php        - Staff creation validation request
app/Http/Requests/StaffUpdateRequest.php       - Staff update validation request
```

### Frontend Files
```
resources/views/admin/Staff/index.blade.php    - Main view with DataTable and modal
public/admin/partial/js/staff.js               - JavaScript functionality
```

### Routes
```php
Route::prefix('staff')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [StaffController::class, 'index'])->name('staff.index');
    Route::get('/get-data', [StaffController::class, 'getData'])->name('staff.getData');
    Route::get('/get-stores', [StaffController::class, 'getStores'])->name('staff.getStores');
    Route::post('/', [StaffController::class, 'store'])->name('staff.store');
    Route::get('/{staff}/edit', [StaffController::class, 'edit'])->name('staff.edit');
    Route::put('/{staff}', [StaffController::class, 'update'])->name('staff.update');
    Route::delete('/{staff}', [StaffController::class, 'destroy'])->name('staff.destroy');
});
```

## Model Details

### Enhanced User Model Features
- **Mass Assignable Fields**: name, email, password, phone, designation, address, avatar, store_id
- **Relationships**: `store()` - belongsTo Store model
- **Scopes**: `fromStore($storeId)` - filters users by store
- **Accessors**: `getFullNameWithStoreAttribute()` - returns name with store info
- **Password Hashing**: Automatic via Laravel's built-in casting
- **Soft Deletes**: Uses SoftDeletes trait for data preservation

### Store Relationship
```php
public function store()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Store::class);
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Staff Creation (StaffStoreRequest)
```php
- name: required, string, max:255, min:2
- email: required, email, max:255, unique:users,email
- password: required, string, min:8, confirmed
- phone: nullable, string, max:20, min:10
- designation: nullable, string, max:255
- address: nullable, string, max:1000
- store_id: required, exists:stores,id
```

### Staff Update (StaffUpdateRequest)
Same as creation rules but:
- Email unique validation ignores current record
- Password is nullable (optional for updates)

## Controller Methods

### StaffController
- `index()`: Returns the main view with title and menu context
- `getData()`: AJAX endpoint returning all active staff with store relationships
- `getStores()`: AJAX endpoint returning active stores for dropdown
- `store()`: Creates new staff with password hashing and store association
- `edit()`: Returns staff data with store relationship for editing
- `update()`: Updates existing staff, optionally updates password
- `destroy()`: Soft deletes staff (sets deleted_at timestamp)

### Response Format
All AJAX endpoints return consistent JSON format:
```json
{
    "success": true/false,
    "message": "Operation message",
    "data": {} // Optional data payload
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

### DataTable Features
- Server-side processing disabled (client-side)
- Responsive design
- Search and sorting enabled
- Custom action buttons (Edit/Delete)
- Store name display with relationship data

### Modal Form
- Bootstrap 5 modal with large size
- Form validation with error display
- Loading states with spinners
- Store dropdown populated via AJAX
- Password confirmation field
- Conditional password requirements (required for create, optional for edit)

### JavaScript Functions
- `initializeDataTable()`: Sets up DataTable configuration
- `loadStores()`: Fetches active stores for dropdown
- `populateStoreDropdown()`: Populates store select options
- `loadStaff()`: Fetches and populates staff data with store relationships
- `populateTable()`: Renders data in DataTable
- `openCreateModal()`: Prepares modal for new staff (password required)
- `openEditModal()`: Fetches and populates edit form (password optional)
- `openDeleteModal()`: SweetAlert confirmation dialog
- `handleFormSubmit()`: Processes form submission with validation
- `handleDelete()`: Processes delete operation
- Form utility functions for validation and reset

## UI/UX Features

### Form Fields
1. **Staff Name**: Text input with placeholder
2. **Email**: Email input for login credentials
3. **Password**: Password input with confirmation (required for create, optional for edit)
4. **Password Confirmation**: Matching password field
5. **Phone Number**: Optional text input
6. **Designation**: Optional text input for job title
7. **Store**: Required dropdown populated with active stores
8. **Address**: Optional textarea

### Table Columns
1. Avatar (circular image or initials)
2. Name
3. Email
4. Phone (displays "N/A" if empty)
5. Designation (displays "N/A" if empty)
6. Store (displays store name or "No Store")
7. Actions (Edit/Delete buttons)

### Navigation
- Added to admin sidebar as "Manage Staffs"
- Uses users icon (fa-users)
- Active state highlighting

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Staff members can use email/password for login
- Password hashing using Laravel's built-in bcrypt
- Currently allows all authenticated admin users to manage staff
- Can be extended with role-based permissions

### Data Management
- Soft delete functionality preserves data integrity
- Deleted staff records are marked with deleted_at timestamp
- Soft deleted records are automatically excluded from queries
- Avatar files are deleted when staff is soft deleted

### Validation
- Comprehensive server-side validation
- Password confirmation requirement
- Email uniqueness validation
- Store existence validation
- XSS protection through Laravel's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection on all forms

## Store Integration

### Store Selection
- Dropdown populated with active stores only
- Required field for all staff members
- Store relationship loaded for display
- Store name displayed in staff table

### Store Relationship Benefits
- Easy filtering of staff by store
- Store-specific staff management
- Hierarchical data organization
- Future extensibility for store-based permissions

## Error Handling

### Backend
- Try-catch blocks in all controller methods
- Consistent error response format
- Validation error handling with field-specific messages
- Password hashing error handling

### Frontend
- AJAX error handling with user-friendly messages
- Form validation error display
- Loading states during operations
- SweetAlert for confirmations and notifications
- Store loading error handling

## Password Management

### Creation
- Password required with minimum 8 characters
- Password confirmation required
- Automatic bcrypt hashing

### Updates
- Password optional (leave blank to keep current)
- Password confirmation required if password provided
- Conditional validation based on edit mode

## Extensibility

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Role Management**: Add roles and permissions system
2. **Profile Pictures**: Avatar upload functionality (✅ Implemented)
3. **Department Assignment**: Add department relationships
4. **Shift Management**: Staff scheduling system
5. **Performance Tracking**: Staff metrics and KPIs
6. **Multi-Store Access**: Staff access to multiple stores
7. **Email Verification**: Account activation system
8. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security
9. **Activity Logging**: Staff action tracking
